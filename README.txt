Original link to JSFiddle, where this project is written on. Anagram is, according to Google "a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman"
and this project is written aimed to help you determine, essentially save time knowing whether a word you're looking at is an anagram or not.
